# 🚘 Vehicle & Number Plate Detection (ANPR)

An end-to-end **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system using **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **OCR** to detect vehicles and extract text from license plates.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how deep learning and computer vision can be combined to build intelligent transportation systems. The system detects vehicles from images, localizes license plate regions, and extracts alphanumeric text.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Python
- Google Colab

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Input image
2. Vehicle detection using YOLOv8
3. Region of interest extraction
4. Plate localization using OpenCV
5. OCR for text extraction
6. Annotated output

---

## 🏙️ Use Cases

- Traffic surveillance
- Smart parking systems
- Toll booth automation
- Law enforcement
- Smart city infrastructure

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- OCR accuracy depends on image quality
- Plate localization is heuristic-based
- No custom model training

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Dedicated license plate detection model
- Real-time video processing
- Improved OCR preprocessing
